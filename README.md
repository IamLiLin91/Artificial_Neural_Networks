## Data Description
This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. "The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes."

**Attribute Information:**
1. mpg: continuous
2. cylinders: multi-valued discrete
3. displacement: continuous
4. horsepower: continuous
5. weight: continuous
6. acceleration: continuous
7. model year: multi-valued discrete
8. origin: multi-valued discrete
9. car name: string (unique for each instance)

## Tasks
1. Import the dataset using the following code:

2. state whether you need to perform any data preprocessing including outliers detection and handling missing values on this dataset, and explain the data insights with appropriate plots.
3. Develop a neural network (NN) model to predict ‘MPG’ and ‘Acceleration’ from a single neural network model using other an important variables as predictors.
4. Optimize your NN model for different training algorithms, activation function, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons in each hidden layer to give the best accuracy.
5. Find RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) of predicted, and actual value from the test dataset.
6. Develop two machine learning models of your choice and optimize the key hyperparameters to achieve the best accuracy to predict the ‘MPG’ and ‘Acceleration’. Repeat step 5 for the machine learning model and find RMSE.
7. Plot bar chart of the accuracy of ANN and machine learning models for ‘MPG’ and ‘Acceleration’ you have obtained from steps 4, and step 6.
